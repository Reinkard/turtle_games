## Ping Pong
#### Pong is a table tennis‚Äìthemed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console.
#### Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

## Snake üêç
### One of the variants of implementation of the well-known Snake game. `Turtle` libraries were used for development.
### The maximum result of the game is recorded in a file names `high_score.txt`

## Crossing Capstone Games
### The simulator uses the following Python libraries for development: `turtle`
