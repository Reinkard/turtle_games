## geography of Ukraine: administrative division

#### A training program for learning the names of the regions of Ukraine.
#### In the input window of the program, you need to enter the name of the region in the genitive case (don\`t forget about Crimea). A counter of correct answers with a mark on the administrative card is also implemented. An `exit` input key is also implemented, after entering which the program ends its work, and the remaining unentered areas (for further study) are output to a separate csv file `./data/states_to_learn.csv`.

## ping Pong

#### Pong is a table tennis‚Äìthemed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console.
#### Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
